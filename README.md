# HTML-and-CSS-tta

Within this folder are various pages I created within guidance by The Tech Academy. 
Some were for problem solving or just to learn new things.

Projects

In the HTML_Project folder, through the index.html file, you will see the first complete page I made on a catagory of my choose about Motorcycles.
I was to get me use to go through various bit of layout and styling via CSS.

In the Bootstrap_4 folder, in this index file, I had made a page entirely through the utilisation of Bootstrap. Again layout was aided here as it was the very first introduction into it.
